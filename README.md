#  Simple ToDo

This is another one of my learning projects: A basic to do list for iPhone, iPad and Mac, synchronized data using iCloud.

This project covers: 

- Core Data for object modeling and data persistence
- Core Data iCloud synchronization to ensure the same data appears on all devices with the same iCloud account
- CloudKit (=manual) record creation and fetching, to allow "publicly" share entries. (=no that's not a real use case, but I wanted to understand what's behind CloudKit and how Core Data interacts with it)
- Discovering friends which use the same app and explore their public items.
- Mac app fCatalyst
- SwiftUI for all UI matters
